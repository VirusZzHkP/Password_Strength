# A password is said to be strong if it satisfies the following criteria: 

    It contains at least one lowercase English character.
    It contains at least one uppercase English character.
    It contains at least one special character. The special characters are: !@#$%^&*()-+
    Its length is at least 8.
    It contains at least one digit.

Given a string, find its strength. Let a strong password is one that satisfies all above conditions. A moderate password is one that satisfies first three conditions and has length at least 6. Otherwise password is week.
